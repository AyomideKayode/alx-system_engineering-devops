# Project: 0x0F. Load balancer

## Resources

- [Introduction to load-balancing and HAproxy](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-haproxy-and-load-balancing-concepts)

## Tasks

0. [Double the number of webservers](./0-custom_http_response_header) :

In this first task you need to configure `web-02` to be identical to `web-01`. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and theyâ€™ll now come in handy to easily configure `web-02`. Remember, always try to automate your work!

Since weâ€™re placing our web servers behind a load balancer for this project, we want to add a custom Nginx response header. The goal here is to be able to track which web server is answering our HTTP requests, to understand and track the way a load balancer works. More in the coming tasks.

Requirements:

- Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on `web-01` and `web-02`)
  - The name of the custom HTTP header must be `X-Served-By`
  - The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
- Write `0-custom_http_response_header` so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
  - Ignore SC2154 for `shellcheck`

Example:

```sh
ayomide@Kazzywiz:~/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x0F-load_balancer$ curl -sI 100.25.151.196 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 444607-web-02
ayomide@Kazzywiz:~/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x0F-load_balancer$ curl -sI 100.26.11.61 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 444607-web-01
ayomide@Kazzywiz:~/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x0F-load_balancer$
```

If your serverâ€™s hostnames are not properly configured ([STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02.), follow this [tutorial](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/linux-static-hostname).

The Hostname configuration in server:

- ssh into server `ssh ubuntu@your_web_ip`
- Edit the Nginx default configuration file: `sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default`
- Add the following line inside the server block, just above the closing brace (}): `add_header X-Served-By $hostname;`
- Restart Nginx to apply the configuration: `sudo service nginx restart`

Repeat saem steps for web-02!ðŸ¥‚
